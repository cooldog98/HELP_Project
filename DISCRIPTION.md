# Palace Game - 2D Action Platformer

[![Project Overview](placeholder_screenshot.png)](placeholder_demo_video.mp4)

**Palace Game** is a dynamic 2D action platformer developed using Python and the Pygame library. This project delivers
classic platforming gameplay with an emphasis on action elements, including player combat and engaging level design.

## ‚ô•Ô∏é Overview and Concept

Palace Game combines traditional platforming mechanics with action-oriented gameplay. Players control a character who navigates through levels, overcoming obstacles and battling enemies. The core gameplay loop involves:

* **Platforming:** Players traverse levels with jumps, movement, and interaction with platforms and the environment.
* **Combat:** Players engage enemies using projectile attacks (bullets), requiring aiming and timing.
* **Level Progression:** Players advance through levels, facing increasing difficulty and challenges.

The concept revolves around creating an engaging and challenging experience within the 2D platformer genre, with a focus on fluid player movement and satisfying combat.
